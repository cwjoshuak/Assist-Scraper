# AssistScraper (WIP)

### Under no circumstances is this efficient, but it works (?)

## Build Instructions
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cwjoshuak/Assist-Scraper.git
$ cd Assist-Scraper
$ swift build
$ swift run
```

### Note
If you want to run it in Xcode, make sure that you are trying to build and run the AssistScraper executable.
