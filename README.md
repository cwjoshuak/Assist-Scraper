# AssistScraper (WIP)

### Under no circumstances is this efficient, but it works (?)

## Build Instructions
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/cwjoshuak/Assist-Scraper.git`
3. `$ cd Assist-Scraper`
4. `$ swift build`
5. `$ swift run`

### Note
If you want to run it in Xcode, make sure that you are trying to build and run the AssistScraper executable.
